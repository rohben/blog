In this article I describe the scheme I use for digitising and managing my
collection of personal documentation (receipts, statements, cards, letters,
etc).

This article is one in a series on [digital asset management][dam].

## Overview

My motivation for digitising my documents is:

* To **simplify filing** (no more filing cabinets and easy disposal of old
  paperwork).
* For **easy searching**.
* For **posterity** (to capture fading receipts, taxation auditing, etc).

Digitising documentation is an on-going task, and as with all chores it needs to
be _fast_ and _easy_ for you to stand any chance of doing it regularly. As such
I've chosen to photograph the documents and tag the images.

**Why photograph?** I already have the equipment (both the hardware and
software) and it's faster than scanning on a desktop scanner. **Why JPEG
Images?** Virtually every device on the planet can open a JPEG and there is a
lot of excellent _free_ software for browsing tagged image collections. It is
also easier to add meta data to images than it is for other formats (PDF, Word).

**What documents do I digitise?** Everything, basically. The obvious things
include statements and receipts, but I also include user manuals, cards
(birthday, christmas, etc), old letters, and my daughter's painting. The reality
is, some things I keep because they're useful (finding a particular receipt for
taxation purposes)

### Workflow

1. Collect original documents for a period of time (week, month, or year) to be
   processed as a batch.

2. Photograph documents.

3. Tag images with meta data describing the document.

4. Group original documents by-year for storage and eventual disposal.

#### Scanning (An Alternative)

1. Scan the documents to PDF (perhaps you have access to a tray-fed
scan-to-email device?) and extract the images from the PDF using ??

Windows

Linux
pdfimages (part of the http://poppler.freedesktop.org/ package).
