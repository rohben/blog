In this article I describe the scheme I use for digitising and managing my
collection of personal documentation (receipts, statements, cards, letters, etc).

## Overview

My motivation for digitising documents is to:

* Simplify filing.
* Make searching easy.
* For posterity.



## Overview

1. Collect original documents for a period of time (week, month, or year) to be
   processed as a batch.

2. Photograph documents.

3. Tag images with meta data describing the document.

4. Group original documents by-year for storage and eventual disposal.

**What documents do I digitise?** If it's paper I capture it! The obvious things
inclue statements and receipts, but I also include user manuals, birthday cards,
old letters.
