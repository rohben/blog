Welcome to the [rohben][] blog, a place for us to share our discoveries and
experiences as we grow our technology company.

## About rohben

Rohan and I started rohben (you see what we did there with the name) a few
months ago to explore the possibility of ultimately working for ourselves. We're
not a hard-and-fast startup working out of California. We didn't quit our day
jobs, and we are certainly not cranking out code at 2am while hyped on caffeine
and guarana. We have families and commitments and while exponential growth and
instant wealth would be nice, we realise this will be a slow and steady grind to
independence, not a fast-paced bolt to internet stardom and really fast cars.

## This blog

I'm coming from an embedded programming background so for me this blog will be a
repository of discoveries as I make the transition from bitwise operators and
flash drivers to web applications and acronym hell. Maybe I'll post something
that someone else will find useful too.
